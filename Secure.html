                <h1>Secure coding review </h1>
                <p>Retrospectively identifying and remediating vulnerabilities in applications can be a time-consuming and costly exercise. The cost to fix an error found after a product release can be four to five times as much as one uncovered during design, and up to 100 times more than one identified in the maintenance phase. In order to mitigate the risk of attack through a bespoke application, it is vital that applications are built securely and are validated through regular penetration testing. </p>
